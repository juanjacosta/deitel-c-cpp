/*
  @file D16_ejr16-12_inventory.cpp
  @brief Create an Inventory class that a warehouse might use to represent
  their stock of products and raw materials. Include a data member of type
  string to provide a description of the product, and data member of type int
  to represent the balance stock.

  Provide a constructor that receives an initial product and uses it to
  initialize the data members.

  The constructor should validate the initial product to ensure it has a stock
  greater than 20, which is the companyâ€™s minimum stock level. If not, it
  should display an error message.

  Provide three member functions:

  - Member function Purchase should add a product to the current stock.
  - Member function Sale should reduce stock. Ensure after each sale that the
  stock level does not drop below 20.
  - Member function getStock should return the current stock.

  Create a program that creates two Inventory objects and tests the member
  functions of the class.
